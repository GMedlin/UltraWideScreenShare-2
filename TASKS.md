# UltraWideScreenShare-2 Task Priority List

## âœ… Completed: Cursor Visibility Investigation (2025-09-28)

### Resolution
After extensive investigation, it was discovered that the **cursor was being captured correctly all along** using the Windows Magnification API. The issue was specific to OBS Game Capture mode when the application window is not focused - this is OBS-specific behavior, not a limitation of our implementation.

**Key Findings:**
- Microsoft Teams and other screen sharing tools capture the cursor correctly
- OBS Window Capture mode works correctly (Game Capture has focus-specific behavior)
- The Windows Magnification API implementation on master branch is working as intended
- No changes to the capture implementation are needed

**Documentation Added:**
- Created TROUBLESHOOTING.md with guidance for OBS users
- Archived experimental Windows Graphics Capture API branch as `archive/wgc-experiment` for reference

### For OBS Users
- Use Window Capture mode instead of Game Capture
- Or keep the UltraWideScreenShare window focused during capture
- See TROUBLESHOOTING.md for details

## Development Workflow

1. **Local Build**: `dotnet build UltraWideScreenShare.WinForms`
2. **Local Run**: `dotnet run --project UltraWideScreenShare.WinForms` (requires .NET 9 runtime)
3. **CI/CD**: Automatic builds on push/PR create downloadable artifacts
